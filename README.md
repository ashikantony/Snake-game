Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play

1. Objective:
    The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

3. Controls:
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
   - The snake will continue moving in the chosen direction until you change it or the game ends.

4. Game Over:
   - The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own tail.
   - Your final score will be displayed on the screen.

5. Scoring:
   - Each time the snake eats food, your score increases by 1.
   - The game speed increases as the score increases, making it more challenging.
